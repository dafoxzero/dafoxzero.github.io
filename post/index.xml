&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes&amp;hellip; Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs&amp;hellip; is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man&amp;rsquo;s best friend&amp;hellip; or the wrong man&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me&amp;hellip; Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your bones don&amp;rsquo;t break, mine do. That&amp;rsquo;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&amp;rsquo;t get sick, I do. That&amp;rsquo;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&amp;rsquo;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.&lt;/p&gt;
